Planting the seeds of tomorrow's generation

## Our Mission
Our mission is to reach underserved youth in Minneapolis communities, primarily elementary students, and introduce them to skills such as digital literacy, computational thinking, and computer programming. As society undergoes this digital revolution, we want to equip students with the necessary skills to make sure that these students are not left behind. It is crucial that we engage students with technology as early as possible, and open up their minds to the opportunities that technology offers.

## About Us
At TechSprouts, our mission is to expand access of critical technological skills to students at underserved schools in the Twin Cities. We are a team of computer science, cybersecurity, and technology students passionate about digital literacy, and develop curriculum for Twin Cities schools. We are a resource for teachers, parents, and students alike.
